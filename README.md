# Pocket Dictionary UWP

This is a project for 4th Year Mobile Applications module as part of a Bsc in Software Development.

The project is a dictionary app for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) which uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern of development.  

To use the app, the user should open the solution file in Visual Studio 15.  Once the app is deployed, the user can input a word into the input box and click the search button to search for its definition.  This project requires access to the internet as the definition is retrieved from an online API.
